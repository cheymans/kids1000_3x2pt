\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have delivered high precision
constraints for the cosmological parameters of the flat, cold dark
matter and cosmological constant model of the Universe
\citep[$\Lambda$CDM,][]{planck/etal:2018}.  With only six free
parameters, this flat $\Lambda$CDM model provides an exquisite fit to observations of
the anisotropies in the CMB.    The same model predicts a range of
different observables in the present day Universe, including the
distribution of, and gravitational lensing by, large-scale
structures \citep{peebles/1980,bartelmann/schneider:2001,eisenstein/etal:2005}, and the rate
of cosmic expansion \citep{weinberg/1972}.  In most cases, there
is agreement between the cosmological parameters of the flat $\Lambda$CDM model
constrained at the CMB epoch, and through a variety of
lower redshift probes \citep[see the discussion in][and references
therein]{planck/etal:2018}.   Recent increases in the statistical
precision of the lower redshift probes has,
however, revealed some statistically significant differences.  Most
notably a $4.4\sigma$ difference in the value of the Hubble constant
$H_0$ has been reported in \citet{riess/etal:2019}.  If this difference can not be
attributed to systematic errors in either, or both, experiment, this result
suggests that the flat $\Lambda$CDM model is incomplete.

Many
extensions have been proposed to reconcile the observed differences between
high and low redshift probes \citep[see for
example][]{poulin/etal:2018,divalentino/etal:2020}.  Each, however, require
an additional component
to the cosmological model that moves even further away from the
standard model of particle physics, a model that already struggles to motivate
the existence of cold dark matter and a cosmological constant.   In these closing phases of the `Stage-III'
surveys, in the run up to the`full-sky' imaging and spectroscopic
cosmology surveys of the 2020's \citep[Euclid, VRO/LSST and DESI,][]{laureijs/etal:2011,lsst/etal:2009,DESI/etal:2016}, the highest
priority is to develop a keen understanding, and mitigation, of systematic errors.

In this analysis we present a multi-probe `same-sky' analysis of the
evolution of large-scale structures, using imaging and spectroscopic surveys.
Our first observable is the weak gravitational lensing of background
galaxies by foreground large scale
structures, commonly referred to as `{\it cosmic shear}'.    Our second
observable is the {\it anisotropic clustering of galaxies} within these
large-scale structures, combining measurements of both redshift-space
distortions and the redshift-dependent scale of the baryon acoustic
oscillation.   Our third observable is the weak gravitational lensing of background
galaxies by foreground galaxies, commonly referrred to as
`{\it galaxy-galaxy lensing}'.   As these three sets of two point
statistics are analysed simultaneously, this combination of probes
is commonly referred to as a `$3\times 2{\rm pt}$' analysis. 

Each observable in our multi-probe analysis is subject to systematic
uncertainties.  For a cosmic shear analysis, the observable is a
combination of the true cosmological signal with a low-level signal
arising from the intrinsic alignment of galaxies and potential residual
correlations in the data induced by the atmosphere, telescope and
camera.   The whole signal can be scaled by both shear
 and photometric redshift measurement calibration errors
 \citep[see][and references therein]{mandelbaum:2018}.   For a galaxy
   clustering analysis, the observable is the true
   cosmological signal modulated by an uncertain, non-linear and
   evolving, galaxy bias function.  It is this function that maps how
   the galaxies trace the
   underlying total matter distribution \citep[see][and references
   therein]{desjacques/etal:2018}.   Finally the galaxy-galaxy
   lensing analysis is subject to the systematics that impact both the
   cosmic shear and clustering analyses.

   When analysising these
   observables in combination
   the different astrophysical and systematic dependencies allow for some degree of
   self-calibration \citep{bernstein/jain:2004, hu/jain:2004,
     bernstein:2009,joachimi/bridle:2010}.  `Same-sky'
   surveys, overlapping imaging for weak lensing observables, with
   spectroscopy for anisotropic galaxy clustering observables,
   also allows for their cross-correlation.  Such a survey design therefore
   presents a robust
   cosmological tool that can calibrate and mitigate systematic and astrophysical
   uncertainties through a series of nuisance parameters.   In
   addition to enhanced systematic control, this combination of probes
   breaks cosmological parameter degeneracies from each individual
   probe, decreasing the
   uncertainty on the recovered dark energy equation of state
   parameter \citep{hu/jain:2004,gaztanaga/etal:2012}.

   Three variants of a joint `$3\times 2{\rm pt}$' analysis have been
   conducted to date.  \citet{vanuitert/etal:2018} present a joint power-spectrum
   analysis of the Kilo-Degree Survey \citep[KiDS][]{kuijken/etal:2015} with
   the Galaxies And Mass Assembly survey
   \citep[GAMA][]{liske/etal:2015}, incorporating projected
   angular clustering measurements.   \citet{joudaki/etal:2018}
   present a joint analysis of KiDS with the
   2-degree Field Lensing Survey \citep[2dFLenS][]{blake/etal:2016}
   and the overlapping area in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey \citep[BOSS][]{alam/etal:2015}, incorporating
   redshift-space clustering measurements.  \citet{abbott/etal:2018}
   present a joint real-space lensing-clustering analysis of the Dark
   Energy Survey \citep[DES][]{drlicawagner/etal:2018}, using a high-quality
   photometric redshift sample of luminous red galaxies for their projected
   angular clustering measurements.  In all three cases an effective
   linear galaxy bias model was adopted.

   In this analysis we enhance and build upon the advances of previous `$3\times
   2{\rm pt}$' studies.   We analyse the most recent KiDS data release \citep[KiDS-1000][]{kuijken/etal:2019}, more than doubling the
   survey area from previous KiDS analyses.   We utilize the full-BOSS
   area and the `full-shape' anisotropic clustering measurements of \citet{sanchez/etal:2017},
   incorporating information from both redshift-space distortions
   and the baryon acoustic oscillation as our galaxy clustering probe.   We adopt a non-linear
   galaxy bias model, derived from renormalised perturbation theory
   \citep{crocce/scoccimarro:2006, chan/etal:2012}.
