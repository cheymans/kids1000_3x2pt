\subsection{Surveys:  KiDS, BOSS and 2dFLenS}
\label{sec:surveys}

The Kilo-Degree Survey \citep[KiDS,][]{dejong/etal:2013}, spans 1350 sq degrees split into two fields, one
equatorial and one southern.    Matched-depth imaging in nine bands spans the optical,
$urgi$, through to the near-infra-red, $ZYJHK_s$, where the
near-infra-red imaging was taken as part of the KiDS partner survey
VIKING \citep[the VISTA Kilo-degree INfrared Galaxy
survey,][]{edge/etal:2013}.  High quality seeing was
routinely allocated to the primary KiDS $r$-band VST-OmegaCAM observations, resulting in a
mean $r$-band seeing of 0.7 arcseconds, with a maximum of 0.8
arcseconds.  This combination of full-area spatial and wavelength
resolution over a thousand square degrees,
provides a unique weak lensing survey that allows for enhanced
control of systematic errors \citep{giblin/etal:inprep, hildebrandt/etal:inprep}.
This analysis uses data from the fourth KiDS
data release of 1006 square degrees of imaging, (hence the name KiDS-1000), which has an effective
area, after masking, of 777 square degrees.  KiDS is a public survey from the European Southern
Observatory, with data products freely accessible through the ESO
archive\footnote{KiDS data access: \href{http://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl/DR4}{kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl/DR4}}.   

\citet{giblin/etal:inprep} presents a series of null-tests to validate the KiDS-1000 shear catalogue in five tomographic bins spanning a 
photometric redshift range of $0.1 < z_{\rm B} < 1.2$ \citep[see table 1 of][for details of the properties of each bin]{giblin/etal:inprep}.    
Meeting their requirement that any systematic detected induces less than a $0.1\sigma$ change in the inferred 
cosmic shear constraints on the clustering cosmological parameter $S_8 = \sqrt{\sigma_8 \Omega_m/0.3}$, they conclude that the shear catalogues are `science-ready'.
\citet{hildebrandt/etal:inprep} presents a cross-correlation clustering analysis to validate the fiducial KiDS-1000 photometric redshift calibration determined using the self-organising map (SOM) methodology of \citet{wright/etal:2020}.   The SOM identifies and excludes any galaxies that are poorly represented in the spectroscopic sample, in terms of their 9-band colours and magnitudes. The resulting `gold' photometric sample, with an accurately calibrated redshift distribution, is then re-simulated in the KiDS image simulations of \citet{kannawadi/etal:2019} in order to determine the shear calibration corrections for each tomographic bin, and an associated uncertainty \citep[see][for full details]{giblin/etal:inprep,hildebrandt/etal:inprep}.
 

The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey
\citep[BOSS,][]{alam/etal:2015}, spans an effective area of 9329 square
degrees, with spectroscopic redshifts for 1.2 million luminous red
galaxies (LRG) in the redshift range $0.2<z<0.9$.   A range of
different statistical analyses of the clustering of BOSS galaxies have been used in combination with CMB
measurements, to set tight contraints on extensions to the standard
flat $\Lambda$CDM model \citep[see][and references
therein]{alam/etal:2017}.   We adopt the anisotropic clustering
measurements of \citet{sanchez/etal:2017} in this multi-probe analysis.
BOSS only overlaps with the equatorial stripe
of the KiDS survey, with 409 square degrees of the BOSS survey lying within
the KiDS-1000 footprint.  BOSS galaxies in this overlapping region are used as lenses in
our galaxy-galaxy lensing analysis, with an effective lens number density of 0.031
galaxies per square arcmin.  BOSS is a public survey from the third Sloan
Digital Sky Survey\footnote{BOSS data access: \href{https://data.sdss.org/sas/dr12/boss/lss/}{data.sdss.org/sas/dr12/boss/lss/}}.   

The two-degree Field Lensing Survey
\citep[2dFLenS,][]{blake/etal:2016}, spans 731 square degrees, with
spectroscopic redshifts for 70,000 galaxies out to $z<0.9$.   This
galaxy redshift survey from the Anglo-Australian Telescope was designed
to target areas already mapped by weak lensing surveys to facilitate `same-sky'
lensing-clustering analyses
\citep{johnson/etal:2017,amon/etal:2018,joudaki/etal:2018, blake/etal:2020}.
We use data from the 2dFLenS LRG sample that was targeted to match
the BOSS-LRG selection, but with sparser sampling.  2dFLenS
thus provides an additional sample of BOSS-like galaxies in the KiDS
southern stripe where there is 425 square degrees of overlap within
the KiDS-1000 footprint.  2dFLenS galaxies in this overlapping region are used as lenses in
our galaxy-galaxy lensing analysis, with an effective lens number density of 0.012
galaxies per square arcmin.  2dFLenS is a public survey\footnote{2dFLenS data

\subsection{Cosmic Shear}
\label{sec:cosmic_shear}
The observed cosmic shear angular power spectrum, $C_{\epsilon \epsilon}(\ell)$, measures a combination of the distortions arising from weak gravitational lensing by large scale structures (labelled with a subscript `G') with a low-level contaminating astrophysical signal arising from the intrinsic alignment of galaxies with the large scale structures within which they are embedded (labelled with a subscript `I').   These contributions can be separated as
\be
\label{eq:cl_cosmicshear}
C^{(ij)}_{\epsilon \epsilon}(\ell) = C^{(ij)}_{\rm GG}(\ell) +
C^{(ij)}_{\rm GI}(\ell) + C^{(ij)}_{\rm IG}(\ell) + C^{(ij)}_{\rm II}(\ell)\;,
\ee
where the indices $i$ and $j$ indicate cross-correlations between the five tomographic source samples.   The theoretical power spectra are given by Limber-approximated projections with
\be
\label{eq:generallimber}
C^{(ij)}_{\rm ab}(\ell) = \int^{\chi_{\rm hor}}_0 \!\!\! \dd \chi\;
\frac{W^{(i)}_{\rm a} (\chi)\; W^{(j)}_{\rm b} (\chi)}{f^2_{\rm
    K}(\chi)}\; P_{\rm m, nl} \br{\frac{\ell+1/2}{f_{\rm K}(\chi)},z(\chi)}\;,
\ee
where ${\rm a,b} \in \bc{\rm I,G}$, $f_{\rm K}(\chi)$ is the comoving angular diameter distance and $\chi$ is the comoving radial distance which runs out to the horizon, $\chi_{\rm hor}$.  The weight functions, $W(\chi)$, encode information about the KiDS-1000 survey depth \citep[see equations 15 and 16 of][]{joachimi/etal:inprep}.   In the cases of power spectra that include intrinsic `I' terms, the weight function also encodes the intrinsic galaxy alignment model which we take to be the `NLA' model from \citet{bridle/king:2007}.   The cosmological information for this statistic is contained in both the geometric weight functions, $W(\chi)$, and in the evolution and shape of the non-linear matter power spectrum, $P_{\rm m, nl}(k,z)$, which we model using the halo formalism\footnote{We calculate the non-linear power spectrum using {\sc HMCode} \citep{mead/etal:2015}, which is incorporated in {\sc CAMB} \citep{lewis/bridle:2002}.   \citet{joachimi/etal:inprep} demonstrate that the \citet{mead/etal:2015} halo model prescription provides a sufficiently accurate model of the non-linear matter power spectrum into the highly non-linear regime through a comparison to weak lensing observables emulated using the N-body CosmicEmu simulations \citep{heitmann/etal:2014}.   It also has the added benefit of allowing us to marginalise over our uncertainty on the impact of baryon feedback on the shape of the non-linear total matter power spectrum \citep{semboloni/etal:2011,mead/etal:2015,mead/etal:2020}.} of \citet{mead/etal:2015}.   Weak lensing is therefore fairly unique as a cosmological probe, as it is sensitive to changes in both the distance-redshift relation and in the growth of structures.

We estimate the cosmic shear angular power spectrum through a linear transformation of the real-space two-point shear correlation function \citep{schneider/etal:2002}.  This approach circumvents the challenge of accurately determining the survey mask for a direct power spectrum estimate.  \citet{joachimi/etal:inprep} detail the apodisation advances that we have adopted for the transformation, in addition to the modelling that we use to account for the minor differences between the theoretical expectation of the true angular power spectrum in equation~\ref{eq:cl_cosmicshear} and the measured `band powers'.    
 
Figure~\ref{fig:Pkk} presents the \citet{asgari/etal:inprep} KiDS-1000 cosmic shear power spectra for the auto and cross-correlated tomographic bins.   Here we have constructed both E-mode (upper left) and B-mode (lower right) band powers in order to isolate any non-lensing B-mode distortions.     As expected from the analysis of \citet{giblin/etal:inprep}, the measured B-modes are found to be consistent with zero.   The measured E-modes can be compared to the theoretical expectation given the best-fit set of cosmological parameters from our joint multi-probe analysis in Section~\ref{sec:results}.

        bin combination is indicated in the upper right corner of each

      consistent with zero for both the full data vector, and each
     bin combination individually.}

\subsection{Anisotropic Galaxy Clustering}
\label{sec:clustering}
Galaxy clustering observations probe the 3D non-linear galaxy-galaxy power spectrum and we follow \citet{sanchez/etal:2017} in modelling this quantity based on a perturbation theory approach with
\be
\label{eq:pgg}
P_{\rm gg}(k,z) = \sum_{\alpha,\beta} \alpha\, \beta\, P_{\alpha
  \beta}(k,z) + b_1 \gamma_3^-\, P_{b_1 \gamma_3^-}(k,z) + P_{\rm noise}(k,z)\;.
\ee
Here $\alpha,\beta \in \bb{b_1, b_2, \gamma_2}$, introducing the linear and quadratic bias parameters $b_1$ and $b_2$, in addition to the non-local bias parameters $ \gamma_2$ and $\gamma_3^-$.  Each of the power spectrum terms on the right hand side of the equation are given by different convolutions of the linear matter power spectrum in appendix A of \citet{sanchez/etal:2017}.   In the case of an effective linear galaxy bias model \citep[see for example][]{vanuitert/etal:2018, abbott/etal:2018} only the $b_1$ bias parameter is considered to be non-zero and equation~\ref{eq:pgg} reduces to $P_{\rm gg}(k,z) =b_1^2 P_{\rm m, nl}^{\rm pert}(k,z)$, where $P_{\rm m, nl}^{\rm pert}(k,z)$ is the pertubation theory estimate of the non-linear matter power spectrum which is accurate at the percent level to $k \lesssim 0.3 h \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$.

\citet{sanchez/etal:2017} present the anisotropic redshift-space correlation function of galaxy clustering, with the galaxy pairs separated into three `wedges' equidistant in $\mu$, where $\mu$ is the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the line connecting the galaxy pairs.   As such the 3D correlation function is measured for pairs that are either mainly transverse to the line of sight, mainly parallel to the line of sight, or placed into an intermediate sample between these two cases.  The redshift-space correlation functions $\xi_{\rm gg} \br{s,\mu,z}$, where $s$ is the co-moving galaxy-pair separation, is given by
\eqa{
\label{eq:bosswedgefouriertrafo}
 \xi_{\rm gg} \br{s,\mu,z} &= \sum_{l=0}^{2} L_{2l}(\mu) \frac{(-1)^l
   (4l+1)}{(2 \pi)^2} \int_0^\infty \dd k\, k^2 {\rm j}_{2l}(ks) \\ \nonumber
& \times \int_{-1}^1
 \dd \mu_1 L_{2l}(\mu_1) P_{\rm gg, s}(k,\mu_1,z)\;,
}
where $L_i$ denotes the Legendre polynomial of degree $i$, ${\rm j}_i$ is the spherical Bessel function of order $i$ and $P_{\rm gg, s}(k,\mu_1,z)$ is the 3D redshift-space power spectrum that includes the non-linear real-space power spectrum (equation~\ref{eq:pgg}) and the galaxy-velocity and velocity-velocity power spectrum \citep[see][for details]{sanchez/etal:2017}.   

Figure~\ref{fig:wedges} presents the \citet{sanchez/etal:2017} BOSS-DR12 anisotropic clustering correlation functions in three wedges.   The measured correlation functions can be compared to the theoretical expectation given the best-fit set of cosmological parameters from our joint multi-probe analysis in Section~\ref{sec:results}.

\subsection{Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing}
\label{sec:GGL}
The observed galaxy-galaxy lensing angular power spectra, $C_{\rm n \epsilon}(\ell)$, measures a combination of weak lensing distortions around foreground galaxies (labelled with a subscript `gG') with a low-level intrinsic alignment signal arising from the fraction of the source galaxy population that reside physically close to the lenses (labelled with a subscript `gI').   We also consider the low-level lensing-induced magnification bias (labelled with a subscript `mG').   These three contributions can be separated as 
\be
\label{eq:cl_ggl}
C^{(ij)}_{\rm n \epsilon}(\ell) = C^{(ij)}_{\rm gG}(\ell) +
C^{(ij)}_{\rm gI}(\ell) + C^{(ij)}_{\rm mG}(\ell)  \;,
\ee
where the index $i$ indicates the two lens galaxy samples, and the index $j$ indicates the five tomographic source samples.   The theoretical power spectra are given by Limber-approximated projections following equation~\ref{eq:generallimber}, with two key differences.   The first is that the lens weight function is replaced by the redshift distribution of the lenses.   The second is that the non-linear matter power spectrum is replaced with the non-linear cross power spectrum between the galaxy and matter distribution $P_{\rm gm}(k,z)$ \citep[see equations 24 and 25 of][for the full expressions]{joachimi/etal:inprep}.   For the magnification bias power spectrum, $C_{\rm mG}(\ell)$, we refer the reader to appendix B in \citet{joachimi/etal:inprep}.   We find that the inclusion or exclusion of this term has a negligible impact on our cosmological constraints, but we retain it nevertheless.

We adopt from non-linear galaxy bias model from \citet{sanchez/etal:2017}, and approximate the non-linear cross power spectrum as
\eqa{
\label{eq:pgm}
P_{\rm gm}(k,z) &= b_1 P_{\rm m, nl}(k,z) + \left\{ b_2\, {\cal F}_{b_2}(k)
  - \gamma_2\, {\cal F}_{\gamma_2}(k) \right.\\ \nonumber
& \left. -\, \gamma_3^-\, {\cal F}_{\gamma_3^-}(k)
 \right\} P_{\rm m, lin}^{2}(k,z)\;,
}
where the logarithm of the functions ${\cal F}_\alpha(k)$ are second-order polynomial fits that we use to model $P_\alpha(k,z_{\rm ref})/P^2_{\rm m, lin}(k,z_{\rm ref})$, the ratio between the different bias terms in the full pertubation theory model in equation~\ref{eq:pgg}, and the square of the linear matter power spectrum.  This approach permits a reasonable extrapolation of the \citet{sanchez/etal:2017} pertubation model into the non-linear regime beyond $k = 0.3 h \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$.   This is necessary in order to carry out the redshift-weighted projection of the 3D model to estimate the 2D galaxy-galaxy lensing observable (equation~\ref{eq:generallimber}).  No matter which $\ell$-scales we restrict our analysis to, high $k$-scales will contribute to all scales at some degree \citep{joachimi/etal:inprep, asgari/etal:2020}.   This approach also yields a several order of magnitude speed-up over the direct perturbative calculations, significantly reducing the galaxy-galaxy lensing likelihood evaluations.  

Figure~\ref{fig:Pgk} presents the KiDS-1000 galaxy-galaxy lensing power spectra, around lenses from the BOSS and 2dFLenS surveys \citep[see][for the real-space KiDS-1000 galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements for BOSS and 2dFLenS separately]{blake/etal:2020}.   Each panel presents the cross correlation between each of the five different tomographic source bins, denoted `S', with the two different lens bins, denoted `L' (see Table~\ref{tab:datatab}).  Here we have constructed both E-mode (left) and B-mode (right) band powers in order to isolate any non-lensing B-mode distortions.     As expected from the analysis of \citet{giblin/etal:inprep}, the measured B-modes are found to be consistent with zero.   The measured E-modes can be compared to the theoretical expectation given the best-fit set of cosmological parameters from our joint multi-probe analysis in Section~\ref{sec:results} in the non-shaded regions.    

The shaded regions in Figure~\ref{fig:Pgk} are excluded from our analysis for two reasons.   For overlapping lens-source bins (L1 with S1 and S2, and L2 with S1 to S3), the intrinsic alignment terms $C_{\rm gI}(\ell)$ are expected to become very significant.   This raises the question of the validity of the arguably rudimentary `NLA' intrinsic alignment model when used in combination with a non-linear galaxy bias model \citep[see][for a self-consistent pertubative approach to both intrinsic alignment and galaxy bias modelling]{blazek/etal:2019}.   As these bins carry little cosmological information, we exclude this data from our cosmological inference analysis, using it instead in a redshift-scaling null test of the catalogue in \citet{giblin/etal:inprep}.   For widely separated lens-source bins (L1 with S3 to S5, and L2 with S4 to S5), we introduce a maximum $\ell$-scale beyond which the contributions from scales $k > 0.3 h \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ become significant \citep[see figure 2 in][]{joachimi/etal:inprep}  In this regime uncertainties in the extrapolation of the \citet{sanchez/etal:2017} non-linear galaxy bias model into the non-linear regime (equation~\ref{eq:pgm}) renders the $C_{\rm n \epsilon}(\ell)$ model invalid.   The $\ell$-limit depends on the redshift of the lens bin.    Figure~\ref{fig:Pgk} therefore serves as excellent illustration of the necessity of improving non-linear galaxy bias modelling for future studies, in order to fully exploit the cosmological signal contained within the galaxy-galaxy lensing observable.
