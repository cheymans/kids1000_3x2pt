  \abstract{We present a joint cosmological analysis of weak gravitational lensing observations from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000), with redshift-space galaxy clustering observations from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), and galaxy-galaxy lensing observations from the overlap between KiDS-1000, BOSS and the spectroscopic 2-degree Field Lensing Survey (2dFLenS).  This combination of large-scale structure probes breaks the degeneracies between cosmological parameters for individual observables, resulting in a constraint on the structure growth parameter $S_8=\sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} =$ \kSeightval, that has the same overall precision as that reported by the full-sky cosmic microwave background observations from {\it Planck}.   The recovered $S_8$ amplitude is low, however, by \kpoffperc relative to {\it Planck}.   This result builds from a series of KiDS-1000 analyses where we validate our methodology with variable depth mock galaxy surveys,  our lensing calibration with image simulations and null-tests, and our optical-to-near-infrared redshift calibration with multi-band mock catalogues and a spectroscopic-photometric clustering analysis.   The systematic uncertainties identified by these analyses are folded through as nuisance parameters in our cosmological analysis.  Inspecting the offset between the marginalised posterior distributions, we find that the $S_8$-difference with {\it Planck} is driven by a tension in the matter fluctuation amplitude parameter, $\sigma_8$.   
We quantify the level of agreement between the CMB and our large-scale structure constraints using a series of different metrics, finding differences with a significance ranging between $\sim\! 2\,\sigma$, when the whole shared parameter space is considered, and $\sim\! 3\,\sigma$ when just considering the discrepancy in $S_{8}$. }

We are completely indebted to Eric Tittley at the IfA for going well beyond the call of duty to save the KiDS-1000 data products after an explosion in our server room destroyed the RAID.   We also thank
our external blinder Matthias Bartelmann who revealed the key for which of the three catalogues analysed was the true unblinded catalogue on the 9th July 2020, right at the end of the KiDS-1000 study which was submitted to A\&A on the 30th July 2020.   We also wish to thank the Vera C. Rubin Observatory LSST-DESC Software Review Policy Committee (Camille Avestruz, Matt Becker, Celine Combet, Mike Jarvis, David Kirkby, Joe Zuntz with CH) for their Software Policy document which we followed, to the best of our abilities, during the KiDS-1000 project.   Following this policy the software used to carry out the various analyses presented in this paper will be made public on publication of this paper. 
The figures in this work were created with \software{matplotlib} \citep{Hunter2007} and \software{getdist} \citep{Lewis2019}, making use of the 
\software{numpy} \citep{Oliphant2006} and \software{scipy} \citep{Jones2001} software packages. We also made extensive use of the {\sc TreeCorr} and {\sc CosmoSIS} software packages and thank
Mike Jarvis and Joe Zuntz for their continuing enhancements and clear documentation.\\

Sloan Foundation, the Participating Institutions, the National Science Foundation, and the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science.   SDSS-III is managed by the Astrophysical Research Consortium for the Participating Institutions of the SDSS-III Collaboration including the University of Arizona, the Brazilian Participation Group, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Florida, the French Participation Group, the German Participation Group, Harvard University, the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias, the Michigan State/Notre Dame/JINA Participation Group, Johns Hopkins University, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics, Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, New Mexico State University, New York University, Ohio State University, Pennsylvania State University, University of Portsmouth, Princeton University, the Spanish Participation Group, University of Tokyo, University of Utah, Vanderbilt University, University of Virginia, University of Washington, and Yale University.\\

The 2dFLenS-related results are based on data acquired through the Australian Astronomical Observatory, under program A/2014B/008. It would not have been possible without the dedicated work of the staff of the AAO in the development and support of the 2dF-AAOmega system, and the running of the AAT.\\
