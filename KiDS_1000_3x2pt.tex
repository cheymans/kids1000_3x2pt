We thank Mike Jarvis for his continuing enhancements, clear documentation and maintenance of the excellent {\sc TreeCorr} software package and our external blinder Matthias Bartelmann who revealed the key for which of the three catalogues analysed was the true unblinded catalogue at the end of the KiDS-1000 study.   We also wish to thank the Vera C. Rubin Observatory LSST-DESC Software Review Policy Committee (Camille Avestruz, Matt Becker, Celine Combet, Mike Jarvis, David Kirkby, Joe Zuntz with CH) for their Software Policy document which we followed, to the best of our abilities, during the KiDS-1000 project.   Following this policy the software used to carry out the various analyses presented in this paper will be made public on publication of this paper.\\

This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme: We acknowledge support from the European Research Council under grant agreement No.~647112 (CH, TT, MA, CL and BG). TT also acknowledges support under the Marie Sk\l{}odowska-Curie grant agreement No.~797794. CH acknowledges support from the Max Planck Society and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in the framework of the Max Planck-Humboldt Research Award endowed by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. HH is supported by a Heisenberg grant of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Hi 1495/5-1). AK acknowledges support from Vici grant 639.043.512, financed by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO). KK acknowledges support by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.\\

The results in this paper are based on observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under programme IDs 177.A-3016, 177.A-3017, 177.A-3018 and 179.A-2004, and on data products produced by the KiDS consortium. The KiDS production team acknowledges support from: Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, ERC, NOVA and NWO-M grants; Target; the University of Padova, and the University Federico II (Naples).\bg{@KK - do we need to add in any VISTA acks?.}\\

The BOSS-related results in this paper have been made possible thanks to SDSS-III. Funding for SDSS-III has been provided by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Participating Institutions, the National Science Foundation, and the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science.   SDSS-III is managed by the Astrophysical Research Consortium for the Participating Institutions of the SDSS-III Collaboration including the University of Arizona, the Brazilian Participation Group, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Florida, the French Participation Group, the German Participation Group, Harvard University, the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias, the Michigan State/Notre Dame/JINA Participation Group, Johns Hopkins University, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics, Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, New Mexico State University, New York University, Ohio State University, Pennsylvania State University, University of Portsmouth, Princeton University, the Spanish Participation Group, University of Tokyo, University of Utah, Vanderbilt University, University of Virginia, University of Washington, and Yale University.\\

The 2dFLenS-related results are based on data acquired through the Australian Astronomical Observatory, under program A/2014B/008. It would not have been possible without the dedicated work of the staff of the AAO in the development and support of the 2dF-AAOmega system, and the running of the AAT.\\

{ {\it Author contributions:}  All authors contributed to the development and writing of this paper.  The authorship list is given in three groups:  the lead authors (CH \& TT) followed by two alphabetical groups.  The first alphabetical group includes those who are key contributors to both the scientific analysis and the data products.  The second group covers those who have either made a significant contribution to the data products, or to the scientific analysis.}
